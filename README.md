# NUMBER-JUMBLER :

The Number Jumbler UI Page presents a dynamic feature: upon clicking the "Regenerate" button, the numeric boxes (ranging from 1 to 9) undergo a randomized rearrangement. This interactive function adds an element of unpredictability, making each click yield a new sequence. 

This engaging mechanism not only offers a playful experience but also exemplifies the concept of algorithmic randomness. Users observe the transformation of the familiar numerical sequence into a fresh, randomized order, highlighting the concept's practical implications in various fields, from cryptography to gaming. 

The Number Jumbler UI Page effectively demonstrates the concept while providing an enjoyable and educational user interaction.
